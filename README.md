8 Puzzle game is a sliding puzzle that consists of a frame of numbered square tiles in random order with one tile missing. The tiles are numbered, 1 thru 8 so that each tile can be uniquely identified.

The web app checks the squares to ensure that the goal state is achieved, if the goal state is reached, then it shows an image indicating that you reached the goal.
